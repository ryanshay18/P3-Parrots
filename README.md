Casino Themed Website with Card Games like War and Blackjack with Animations and Probability of Winning Displayed

## Blackjack
We created a simple blackjack card game which gives the user a probability of winning the match. The player will be playing against a AI dealer that is fully working. The game will be played just as how most regular blackjack games are. As well, the wins and losses are displayed on the screen to keep track of the player's winnings and losings.

## War
We are going to create a card game where the user can play war against an ai bot, where both players randomly draw a card from a deck. After the player draws a card, we give them the probability of him winning the game. The player plays their card and the ai bot plays a random card, and the higher valued card wins. We will have animation for the player as they play the game. For the home page, it can be an entrance to a fake online casino for visual effect.
