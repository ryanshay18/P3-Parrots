# Runtime Link http://104.2.84.172/
Once you are on the website, navigate to the menu at the top and head either to the Blackjack game or War game. For the blackjack game, select the Start button and then continue to play the game. If you do not remember the rules, scroll down to the blackjack section of this Readme. For the war game, select the Start button and continue to Flip. The first to 10 wins. If you do not remember the rules, scroll down to the war section of this Readme. If you would like to review our main page, we have other discriptions of the orgins of these games and other artifacts.

## Easter Egg
The Easter Egg on our project is a secret page that can be accessed from the secret button underneath the generate button in the random fact generator section on our home page. The code for the easter egg can be found here. [Button](https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/blob/879e02f71c478fa0ae9fa744ac6925df4f63bd2e/templates/index.html#L83), [Blueprint](https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/blob/main/easteregg/__init__.py), [Python](https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/blob/main/easteregg/view.py)

## Scrum Team Cards/Ticket
Our 4 goals were War Game, Blackjack Game, Deployment, and Embed both games into HTML. All goals were [met](https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/projects/1#column-11994163). Each individual completed their task fully but was a bit sloppy so Max(Scrum Leader) decided to knock -1 off. The sloppiness mostly refers to routing of the images of the cards and for deployment, the background on the war game would load in our Intellij's local host but not the deployment so -1 for Max. The background for the War Game should look like [this](https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/issues/2#issue-787376063).
## 4 Big Tickets Assignment
| Name | Big Ticket | Scrum Board/Github Code Artifcat |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Ahmad Nasim 19/20| Black Game embed on Website | The Big Ticket is the blackjack code I created from python, however we need to transfer it to javascript to be able to run it in html. In order to play the game, you would click 'start' 'hit' or'stand' and the goal is to get 21 or more than the dealer. Github: https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/blob/main/templates/blackjack.html
|  Shekar Krishnamoorthy 19/20| Embed War on Website| Embedded the actual war game Ryan Shay made by using API called Transcrypt which turns python code into javascript in order to be ran on a website Github: https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/blob/main/templates/war.html   |
|  Ryan Shay 19/20| Create War Game | Created the War game with python (later turned into Javascript) Click 'Flip' to play when on runtime Github: https://github.com/shekark642/P4Birds/commit/f270a6989529d6b2f4d7125c2f006a939cfa1884 |
|  Max Vukovich 19/20| Deployment of Website| Cloned new repository and deployed new project off of raspberry pi [HERE](http://104.2.84.172/)  |

Casino Themed Website with Card Games like War and Blackjack with Animations and Probability of Winning Displayed

## Blackjack
We created a simple blackjack card game which gives the user a probability of winning the match. The player will be playing against a AI dealer that is fully working. The game will be played just as how most regular blackjack games are. As well, the wins and losses are displayed on the screen to keep track of the player's winnings and losings.

## War
We are going to create a card game where the user can play war against an ai bot, where both players randomly draw a card from a deck. After the player draws a card, we give them the probability of him winning the game. The player plays their card and the ai bot plays a random card, and the higher valued card wins. We will have animation for the player as they play the game. For the home page, it can be an entrance to a fake online casino for visual effect.


## Map of project to AP CSP requirements
[Computer Science Principlse Course Cpnten description pages 19, 20, 21](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-computer-science-principles-course-and-exam-description.pdf?course=ap-computer-science-principles)

| Unit | Percentage | Hello Series usage |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|  Big Idea 1: Creative Computing | 10-13% | Plans for multiple animations for game such as board, cards, and the dealer through the usage of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  |
|  Big Idea 2: Data | 17-22% | Probability and user defined data in the entirety of the game. Leaderboard:using data of scores of users with profiles.  |
|  Big Idea 3: Algorithms and Programming | 30-35% | Usage of old ideas such as Jinja and simple html tasks and new ideas. |
|  Big Idea 4: Computer Systems and Network | 11-15% | Further invest into deployment and GET and POST that relates to newly learned information.  |
|  Big Idea 5: Impact of Computing | 21-26% |  Usage of a game that shows defined data like old game wins and probability and is user friendly so individuals can access and play easy.. |
